# BoolF

BoolF is a Boolean function-based method designed to infer Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from time-series gene expression data. It works by exhaustively searching for optimal regulatory genes for a target gene using conjunction and disjunction Boolean functions. This process identifies the set of regulatory genes that best fits the target gene with minimal errors. The method represents genes as binary states—active (ON) or inactive (OFF)—and uses Boolean logic to model the regulatory interactions between genes.

# How to run this method

Setup environment for C++ programming language and clone this repository. Then, edit the Network_input, output, and actual_output file path. Finally, run the BoolF.cpp file
