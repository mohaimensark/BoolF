BoolF is a Boolean function-based method designed to infer Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from time-series gene expression data. It works by exhaustively searching for optimal regulatory genes for a target gene using conjunction and disjunction Boolean functions. This process identifies the set of regulatory genes that best fits the target gene with minimal errors.
